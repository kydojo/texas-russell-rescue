            Russell Rescue, Inc. is funded entirely through donations.  We are supported by Jack Russell lovers and

            All donations made to Russell Rescue are tax-deductible to the contributor. <br><br>

            Jack Russells entering our rescue program often require medical care.  Donations are used to provide
            veterinary care including spaying/neutering, vaccinations, surgeries, medications, heartworm testing and
            treatment, etc.  We provide the care necessary for our Jack Russellâ€™s to be healthy and ready to be
            adopted.<br><br>

            We try and make it easy for you to support us.  Donations can be made with PayPal, all major credit cards,
            money orders or cashiers checks and personal checks.  When donating, please include your mailing address so
            we can send you a tax deduction letter. <br><br>
